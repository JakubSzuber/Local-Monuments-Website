# This is a Docker Compose file that sets up three services: flask-database, wsgi-server, and proxy-server.
# The flask-database service uses a custom postgres image, has resources limits and reservations set, and has environment
# variables set for the Postgres user, password, and database name.
# The wsgi-server service uses a custom gunicorn image and has resources limits and reservations set. It also depends
# on the flask-database service.
# The proxy-server service uses a custom nginx image, has resources limits and reservations set, and exposes port 80.
# It also depends on the wsgi-server service.
# The file also sets up a volume named postgres_data.
