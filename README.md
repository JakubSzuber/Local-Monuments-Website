# Local-Monuments-Website
This project is containerized web application created form scratch. Whole application is totally my autorship. This project show plenty of ways to run this app but I recommend you to choose the standard Docker commands or Docker Compose becouse of they complexity and short time required to run an app. When you already run this app you could enter [localhost:80](https://localhost:80) to see page interface where you can click to see next slide with next Poland's monument.
