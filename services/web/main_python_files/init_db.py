The church closes the eastern frontage of the Old Town Square from the south. The lump of the collegiate church is visible from all roads leading into the city. In the Stargard landscape, only the tower of St. John's Church - the third-highest in the province, after the Szczecin Archcathedral and St. Mary's Church in Chojna - is comparable to it in height. The tower of the Collegiate Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, on the other hand, with its height of 83.5 meters, ranks nineteenth in the country and fifth in the province. The church is often referred to (incorrectly) as a cathedral because of its stately bulk.', ' The original temple was built in 1242, and was made of wood or granite blocks. The establishment of the first church in this place is associated with the location of the city under the Magdeburg law. The church was built - in accordance with the location law - at the newly delineated market square (later Old Town Square). The earliest mention of the functioning of a church in this place comes from 1248, from a document of the Bishop of Kamień Pomorski handing the city over to the Pomeranian principality. In 1292 it was decided to build a new, larger temple. It was to be a votive offering for the granting of Lübeck city rights. The first Gothic brick church was built between 1292 and 1224 on the site of a wooden temple from 1242.The new church was hall-shaped. Inside, it was divided into three naves with an eastern projecting chancel. From the west it was closed with a stepped gable decorated with slender blends. At that time it was a towerless building. At this stage of construction it was modeled on St. Mary's Church in Kolobrzeg.', ' In 1388-1500 the church was rebuilt according to the vision of Henrik Brunsberg. It was given the form of a basilica, adding, among other things, a new chancel and a wreath of chapels around the temple, as well as St. Mary's Chapel and towers. It was equipped (also by private donors) with more than 50 altars, eight bells and three organs. After the introduction of the Reformation in Pomerania (1534), the Stargard church was also converted to the Lutheran faith. In the 17th century, the church was severely damaged by fire, as was the entire city. Reconstruction took 25 years and gave it a Baroque décor. The regilding was carried out twice: in 1817-19 under the direction of K. Liebenow and at the turn of the 19th/20th century under the direction of Deneke. After he completed the work, the rededication of the temple took place on August 30, 1911 in the presence of the imperial couple - Wilhelm II and Augusta Victoria. As a result of World War II, the roofs and north tower were destroyed, while the interior was devastated. After a makeshift reconstruction in 1946-48, the building was used as a warehouse - until 1957, when Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski reconsecrated the church. Reconstruction continued, and in 1962 the tower's helmet was restored; in 1966 a stained glass window dedicated to the parish's patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of the World, was funded; it was installed in the window of the western elevation, above the main portal. A new organ was also funded. Until the 1970s, the church was classified as a zero-class monument in the classification of the time. In 1995 it was given the status of a collegiate church. In 2001, renovations began on St. Mary's Chapel and the north tower, where an observation deck was opened in 2006. A year later, replacement of the roof tiles over the nave, side aisles and chapels began. At that time, elements of the early 20th century stained glass windows were replenished. Restoration of the temple's exterior walls is expected in the coming years. The collegiate church is the seat of the dean of the Stargard East deanery. By decree of the President of the Republic of Poland on September 17, 2010, the collegiate church along with the system of defensive walls was declared a monument of history.', ' The Collegiate Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the southeast corner of Old Town Square, and is oriented according to medieval principles - the chancel facing east. It was built of brick on granite block foundations. It was built on the plan of an elongated rectangle closed on the eastern side with a polygon. The total length of the church is 79.5 m, the width is 37.8 m, the height of the nave is 32.5 m, (it is the highest vaulted church in Poland). The temple is almost entirely a medieval building, erected in stages from the end of the 13th century to the end of the 15th century. As a result of the long construction process, the original church (from the turn of the 13th century), a hall-like, towerless church with a single nave chancel, obtained at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries the shape of a two-towered basilica with a chancel surrounded by an enclosure nave and a wreath of chapels at the enclosure and side aisles. The most impressive body was given to St. Mary's Chapel established on the north side of the bypass in the form of an octagon protruding beyond the face of the walls, covered with a separate tented roof. On the opposite, southern side, a rectangular sacristy was built with the Angelic Chapel on the first floor. The facade and interior wall divisions of the various parts of the church; the chancel, the nave body, the chapels at the side aisles and the towers are varied. The different ways of elaborating the walls, windows, pillars, vaults and architectural details of the parts of the buildings are due to the long process of their erection, and reflect the changes in the development of architecture in Pomerania.', ' No one has been able to answer the question of why the old Gothic St. Mary's Church in Stargard has two towers, but only one of them - the northern one - is large and imposing, while the other - the southern one - is lower, it is clear that it is unfinished. According to legend, disputes over what St. Mary's Church should be like and what its towers should be like erupted even before its construction began in the late 13th century. At the time, Pomerania was ruled by the princes of the Gryfit dynasty. The councilors only agreed that it should be a church so large and magnificent that it would arouse the envy of the inhabitants of Szczecin and even Poznan. However, when they began to discuss how many towers the church should have, the councilors split and an incredible uproar ensued; the mayor struggled to direct the proceedings. The oldest councillor - Luke, the guide of the church's brotherhood - declared: There is one God in heaven and one pope, his governor on earth, so the church should also have one tower, but soaring and high, so that prayers can reach heaven sooner. When it seemed that everyone had accepted his statement, a fat, red in the face merchant, Councilman Henry, who had his cloth depots in Hamburg and Bremen, spoke up: Luke speaks well to us, but this is still not the whole truth, after all, we know that in the world we have two rulers - the pope in ecclesiastical matters and the emperor in secular matters, so let's dedicate one tower to the pope and the other to the emperor. Still others, and among them the biggest raptus, the elder of the shoemakers' guild - Krzych Dratwa, were in favor of dedicating one tower to the prince instead of the emperor: after all, he is ours and lives closer. The day was approaching west, and there was no agreement. However, the church began to be built, and years later the tall north tower was erected and named the papal tower. As the second, the imperial tower was to be elevated, but then a war broke out in Europe between the emperor and the pope for the primacy of world government, and it was not known who would prevail. The southern tower was also not erected because the fashion in architecture was for a single tower in churches.', 'https://zabytki.tomekzuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stargard-kosciol-NMP-Krolowej-Swiata-01.jpg')")
