The church closes the eastern frontage of the Old Town Square from the south. The lump of the collegiate church is visible from all roads leading into the city. In the Stargard landscape, only the tower of St. John's Church - the third-highest in the province, after the Szczecin Archcathedral and St. Mary's Church in Chojna - is comparable to it in height. The tower of the Collegiate Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, on the other hand, with its height of 83.5 meters, ranks nineteenth in the country and fifth in the province. The church is often referred to (incorrectly) as a cathedral because of its stately bulk.', ' The original temple was built in 1242, and was made of wood or granite blocks. The establishment of the first church in this place is associated with the location of the city under the Magdeburg law. The church was built - in accordance with the location law - at the newly delineated market square (later Old Town Square). The earliest mention of the functioning of a church in this place comes from 1248, from a document of the Bishop of Kamień Pomorski handing the city over to the Pomeranian principality. In 1292 it was decided to build a new, larger temple. It was to be a votive offering for the granting of Lübeck city rights. The first Gothic brick church was built between 1292 and 1224 on the site of a wooden temple from 1242.The new church was hall-shaped. Inside, it was divided into three naves with an eastern projecting chancel. From the west it was closed with a stepped gable decorated with slender blends. At that time it was a towerless building. At this stage of construction it was modeled on St. Mary's Church in Kolobrzeg.', ' In 1388-1500 the church was rebuilt according to the vision of Henrik Brunsberg. It was given the form of a basilica, adding, among other things, a new chancel and a wreath of chapels around the temple, as well as St. Mary's Chapel and towers. It was equipped (also by private donors) with more than 50 altars, eight bells and three organs. After the introduction of the Reformation in Pomerania (1534), the Stargard church was also converted to the Lutheran faith. In the 17th century, the church was severely damaged by fire, as was the entire city. Reconstruction took 25 years and gave it a Baroque décor. The regilding was carried out twice: in 1817-19 under the direction of K. Liebenow and at the turn of the 19th/20th century under the direction of Deneke. After he completed the work, the rededication of the temple took place on August 30, 1911 in the presence of the imperial couple - Wilhelm II and Augusta Victoria. As a result of World War II, the roofs and north tower were destroyed, while the interior was devastated. After a makeshift reconstruction in 1946-48, the building was used as a warehouse - until 1957, when Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski reconsecrated the church. Reconstruction continued, and in 1962 the tower's helmet was restored; in 1966 a stained glass window dedicated to the parish's patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of the World, was funded; it was installed in the window of the western elevation, above the main portal. A new organ was also funded. Until the 1970s, the church was classified as a zero-class monument in the classification of the time. In 1995 it was given the status of a collegiate church. In 2001, renovations began on St. Mary's Chapel and the north tower, where an observation deck was opened in 2006. A year later, replacement of the roof tiles over the nave, side aisles and chapels began. At that time, elements of the early 20th century stained glass windows were replenished. Restoration of the temple's exterior walls is expected in the coming years. The collegiate church is the seat of the dean of the Stargard East deanery. By decree of the President of the Republic of Poland on September 17, 2010, the collegiate church along with the system of defensive walls was declared a monument of history.', ' The Collegiate Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the southeast corner of Old Town Square, and is oriented according to medieval principles - the chancel facing east. It was built of brick on granite block foundations. It was built on the plan of an elongated rectangle closed on the eastern side with a polygon. The total length of the church is 79.5 m, the width is 37.8 m, the height of the nave is 32.5 m, (it is the highest vaulted church in Poland). The temple is almost entirely a medieval building, erected in stages from the end of the 13th century to the end of the 15th century. As a result of the long construction process, the original church (from the turn of the 13th century), a hall-like, towerless church with a single nave chancel, obtained at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries the shape of a two-towered basilica with a chancel surrounded by an enclosure nave and a wreath of chapels at the enclosure and side aisles. The most impressive body was given to St. Mary's Chapel established on the north side of the bypass in the form of an octagon protruding beyond the face of the walls, covered with a separate tented roof. On the opposite, southern side, a rectangular sacristy was built with the Angelic Chapel on the first floor. The facade and interior wall divisions of the various parts of the church; the chancel, the nave body, the chapels at the side aisles and the towers are varied. The different ways of elaborating the walls, windows, pillars, vaults and architectural details of the parts of the buildings are due to the long process of their erection, and reflect the changes in the development of architecture in Pomerania.', ' No one has been able to answer the question of why the old Gothic St. Mary's Church in Stargard has two towers, but only one of them - the northern one - is large and imposing, while the other - the southern one - is lower, it is clear that it is unfinished. According to legend, disputes over what St. Mary's Church should be like and what its towers should be like erupted even before its construction began in the late 13th century. At the time, Pomerania was ruled by the princes of the Gryfit dynasty. The councilors only agreed that it should be a church so large and magnificent that it would arouse the envy of the inhabitants of Szczecin and even Poznan. However, when they began to discuss how many towers the church should have, the councilors split and an incredible uproar ensued; the mayor struggled to direct the proceedings. The oldest councillor - Luke, the guide of the church's brotherhood - declared: There is one God in heaven and one pope, his governor on earth, so the church should also have one tower, but soaring and high, so that prayers can reach heaven sooner. When it seemed that everyone had accepted his statement, a fat, red in the face merchant, Councilman Henry, who had his cloth depots in Hamburg and Bremen, spoke up: Luke speaks well to us, but this is still not the whole truth, after all, we know that in the world we have two rulers - the pope in ecclesiastical matters and the emperor in secular matters, so let's dedicate one tower to the pope and the other to the emperor. Still others, and among them the biggest raptus, the elder of the shoemakers' guild - Krzych Dratwa, were in favor of dedicating one tower to the prince instead of the emperor: after all, he is ours and lives closer. The day was approaching west, and there was no agreement. However, the church began to be built, and years later the tall north tower was erected and named the papal tower. As the second, the imperial tower was to be elevated, but then a war broke out in Europe between the emperor and the pope for the primacy of world government, and it was not known who would prevail. The southern tower was also not erected because the fashion in architecture was for a single tower in churches.', 'https://zabytki.tomekzuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stargard-kosciol-NMP-Krolowej-Swiata-01.jpg')")

The Gothic St. John the Baptist Church dominates Stargard's skyline and is its tallest building. In its present form it dates from the 15th century, but its architectural and historical tradition puts it at the top of Stargard's churches. In the 13th century the Stargard Order of St. John of Jerusalem built a monastery and a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist here. Although no written information about the shape of this chapel has survived, it is possible to partially reconstruct its form from fragments salvaged in the pillars of the chancel of the present church.  In 1351, Odilia, the wife of Novogard craftsman Heinrich Schmidt, founded altars dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle, St. Margaret and St. Jerome.  In 1388, the clergyman Reynoldus Block donated 200 marks for the making of the altar of the Body of Christ, which was founded in 1429 by Father Albert Tuscher. The foundation of the altar of the Body of Christ was connected with the establishment of the Confraternity of the Holy Body (or Blessed Sacrament). The chapel with the altar was probably initially located outside the Chapel of St. John the Baptist. Later it was moved to a chapel added to the north side. In 1398, a decision was made to expand the St. John's Chapel into a church under the auspices of the City Council. For ten years funds were raised so that in 1408 construction of the tower and the body of the church began simultaneously. The start of construction is indicated by a plaque set into the wall of the tower, made of limestone, which bears the following Latin inscription: \"and was in the year 1408, on the day of the martyrdom of St. George [April 24] with the help of Messrs. Matthew Schonenberch, Henning Busseler, Henry Bachwerk of the provisionals of this church. God's work has begun.\" St. John's Chapel now became the chancel of the new church. Construction of the tower began on the west side. Meanwhile, the space between the chancel and the tower was transformed into the body of the church. Star vaults in the shape of eight-pointed stars were also established.', ' In one of the oldest views of Stargard dating back to the 17th century, the church tower has a crenellation, characteristic of medieval defensive buildings. A pyramid sprouts from its rim. The tower was completed in 1429, at which time the St. Mary's Chapel was erected on the south side. Today the entrance to the tower is located there. Finally, in 1463, the oldest of the bells was founded. Around 1500, a chancel bypass and a series of chapels were erected to surround the eastern part of the church. Cross and crystal vaults were created in them. Crystal vaults (not counting those of the Dominican church in Mysliborz) are a rarity in all of Western Pomerania. Counting from the side of the sacristy, the following chapels were erected: the Canvassers, St. Nicholas, the Three Kings (under the patronage of the Knights of St. John), the Ten Thousand Knights and Martyrs (belonging to the von Köseke, Maskow and Walter families), St. Philip and James (the bakers' chapel), the Furriers and the St. Andrew's Chapel, which does not exist today. In 1556, the church passed into the hands of a Protestant clergyman - Hermann Ricke. As required by the principles of the Protestant liturgy, wooden empores (balconies) were built between the pillars, and a pulpit took center stage in the church.', ' During the Napoleonic wars, the church was requisitioned for five years by French troops. In 1813 a lazaret was set up in the temple, then a hay store, and finally it was turned into a prison. After the fall of Napoleon, the church again served a religious function, new plaster and flooring were put on, and stained glass windows were inserted. However, in 1836 a powerful windstorm tore off the roof over the body of the church. The church was repaired inside the nave body in 1883, while the rest of the building was restored in late 1892 and early 1893. At that time, the southern elevation of the body was redone, the western portal in the tower was bricked up and a new one - narrower and lower - was put in place. The most visible change was the establishment of a new tower helmet, whose height (including the tower) is 99 meters. Since the destruction of the tower helmet of St. Jacob's Cathedral in Szczecin in 1945, the tower of St. John's is the tallest in Western Pomerania and the third tallest in Poland.', ' As a result of the invasion of Soviet troops in March 1945, the roof over the body of the church was partially destroyed, which was repaired a year later. Meanwhile, two artillery shells were lodged in the tower. The church was consecrated on June 19, 1946 by Father Tadeusz Długopolski TChr, the first parish priest in post-war Stargard. The historic furnishings of the church were dispersed. Until World War II, the most valuable equipment in the church was a large late Gothic St. John's polyptych from the second half of the 15th century, the work of a Pomeranian workshop, with, however, visible influences from the art of Hamburg and Rostock. The central cabinet housed large sculptures of Mary and Christ and scenes from the life of St. John. It was dismantled before the war effort in 1945 and deposited in the Tychow branch church. The Baroque pulpit was taken deep into Germany in 1945. In 1954, the roof was repaired and the organ was restored. Three years later, new floors were laid, a balustrade was set up in front of the chancel, two bells were repaired and repair work began on the church tower. In 1958-1961, the interior was renovated. Polychromes of the Archangels, Evangelists and the scene of Christ's Baptism in the Jordan River were also created at this time. The next two saw the installation of an electrical system, which the church had previously lacked, lighting and a sound system. In the mid-1990s, the interior of the church was painted.', ' In the spring of 1998, during repairs to the tower's finial, a collection of documents and coins was discovered, along with a letter from the church's pastor, dated August 17, 1893, placed in a metal ball. The discovered items are stored at the Museum of Archeology and History at the Old Town Square. Until World War II, St. John's Church had rich furnishings. Its most valuable element was a large late Gothic St. John's polyptych from the second half of the 15th century, the work of a Pomeranian workshop, but with visible influences from the art of Hamburg and Rostock. The central cabinet housed large sculptures of Mary and Christ and scenes from the life of St. John. It was dismantled before the war effort in 1945 and deposited in the Tychow branch church. It is now in the National Museum in Szczecin. The Baroque pulpit was taken deep into Germany in 1945. The organ, built by organmaster Wagner, dates from 1731. In the northern part of the church by the sacristy are 15th century four-seat stalls with carved walls. In 2005 the relics of St. Raphael Kalinowski were purchased for the church.', 'https://www.pomorzezachodnie.travel/media/cache/artykul_miniatura_big/media/original/media/default/0001/06/8197bedfd5a1277284357f83be8b29945aa49fc3.JPG')")

Pyrzycka Gate, St. Mary's Collegiate Church and the rest of the defensive walls were declared a monument of history by a decree of the President of Poland on September 17, 2010.  The origins of its construction are associated with the period of the city walls at the end of the 13th century. This refers to the stone part with a height of 6 meters. The brick part is slightly younger (1439), when three stories were added above the passage. To enter the medieval town, one had to pass the front gate under the watchful eye of the guards, which consisted of two low, interconnected towers, followed by a brick tunnel called the throat, a drawbridge over the moat and an inner gate closed with a portcullis. In the 1950s the gate underwent renovation, after which it temporarily housed the Stargard City Museum, and then became the headquarters of the City Branch of PTTK. The last major renovation was carried out in 1991-1993. Currently, the Pyrzyce Gate is one of the facilities administered by the Stargard Archaeological and Historical Museum (educational activities, museum lessons and workshops)', ' The base of the gate, in the form of a square (11x11m), is made of fieldstones, the other three tiers are made of brick. The gate is topped with two gables connected by a saddle roof. The passage in the gate is formed by a spur, closed from the outside with a hard-hewn harrow, after which a drain gap has been preserved. The third floor houses a defensive porch with shotguns. The elevations are dismembered by rows of blends, which also contain the gunnels. The blends show a wealth of forms: pointed, circular and semicircular. The gable part is decorated on the sides with small blends in the shape of shields. Next, a two-part foreboding was built in front of the gate's front. The Pyrzyce gate's fore-gate was rebuilt after a fire in 1666, and was finally demolished in the late 19th century.', ' The Pyrzycka Gate served as the entrance and defense of the city. It is the most magnificent gate leading to the former Stargard. Crowned on both sides with a stone defensive wall, it was built in the 12th (stone base) and 15th centuries (brick tiers). It rises on the base of a square measuring 11 x 11 meters. It is finished with two gables, connected by a gabled roof. It contains a sharp-arched passage, formerly closed with a wrought-iron portcullis. On the third floor there was a defensive porch with shooting holes. They were also located in the façade section, separated by circular or ogival blends. After the war, the gate housed the city museum, later the premises were given to the PTTK branch. Currently it houses the office of the Stargard Chamber of Commerce; visiting the gate is possible during office hours and after prior telephone contact.', ' Stargard is a clear example of a city with an organic continuity of its spatial form. On the eastern section of the walls, the Gothic Pyrzyce Gate stands out. It was built in 1439, and its name comes from the Treaty of Pyrzyce. It is the inner gate of the original layout, consisting, moreover, of a mid-gate and a pre-gate demolished in 1607. The basic square-shaped gate is made of stone, the other three tiers are built of brick. It is the most imposing of the four entrance gates to the medieval city that has survived to the present time. The origins of its construction are associated with the period of the construction of the defensive walls at the end of the 13th century. This refers to the stone part of the Pyrzyce Gate - a square measuring 11x11 meters, reaching 6 meters in height. The brick part is slightly younger and dates back to the first half of the 15th century. The gate is topped with two gables connected by a saddle roof. The gate's passage is formed by a beautiful ogive, closed from the outside by a hard-hewn gate, of which a drain gap has been preserved. When the three stories above the passage were added. The top floor covered porch with openings and soaring - had a defensive function. The stepped gables were decorated with ornaments in the form of blends. Blends indicate a wealth of forms: pointed, circular and semicircular. The gable part is decorated on the sides with small blends in the shape of coat of arms shields against a background of Gothic brick masonry. Next, a two-part forearm was brought in front of the front of the gate. In order to enter the medieval town, one had to pass the front gate under the watchful eye of the guards, which consisted of two low, interconnected towers, then a brick tunnel called a throat, a drawbridge over the moat and an inner gate called a harrow, i.e. a raised trellis.', ' The guides of this gate are still preserved in a sharp-arched recess, visible on the front of the gate. Entrance to the upper floors leads from the side of the city by steps placed in the thick walls of the walls. The front of the Pyrzyce Gate was rebuilt after a fire in 1666, and was finally demolished in the late 19th century. The gate housed bedrooms for the crew, and from the upper gallery the entrance to the city was guarded day and night. The different floors were separated by wooden ceilings connected by stairs. Later alterations were limited only to the gable part of the building. In the 17th century, a signature was placed on the roof, and clock faces were placed in the gables. It even hung a small bell, cast in 1697 by Mangold. In 1899, the signature was removed and the former gallery openings, previously used for residential purposes, were restored. By then, the gate was already partially blended into the 18th and 19th century buildings. After the destruction of the last war, it was one of the first monuments in Stargard rebuilt by the Provincial Conservator in 1956. In the interiors, reinforced concrete ceilings were installed, and the roof truss was restored. Since 1957 the gate has housed the local branch of PTTK, and since 1960 also the newly established Museum, dedicated to the past of Stargard and Stargard Land. The last major renovation was carried out in 1991-1993.', 'https://pomorzezachodnie.travel/media/cache/artykul_miniatura_big/media/original/media/default/0001/11/0855d730bd2feba4dc7cf5ae01286aac2d9828d9.JPG')")

In the old days a small bell hung there.', ' It was built in 1439 and had the most elaborate fore-gate in Stargard. The name comes from the earthen ramparts mounded in front of the outer city walls. In 1780 the fore-gate was demolished and the bricks were used to build a mill on the Ina River. After the destruction of World War II, it was completely rebuilt. The Renaissance part in the upper part of the building was also reconstructed. It is the only Renaissance-style city gate with Gothic relics in the region. After the war, the rooms above the sharp-arched passage were used, among other things, by an outpatient clinic conducting specialized driver examinations.', ' The Embankment Gate is a building erected from the 15th to the 17th century.

Należy do unikatowych zabytków tego typu w Europie, zarówno przez funkcję jaką pełniła w średniowieczu, ale także ze względu na wyjątkową architekturę. Brama Młyńska, kolegiata Mariacka i pozostałe mury obronne rozporządzeniem Prezydenta RP z dnia 17 września 2010 została uznana za pomnik historii.', ' Należy do najbardziej charakterystycznych budowli Stargardu. Zbudowana została prawdopodobnie w pierwszej połowie XV w. Jej rysunek zamieszczony był na dawnych pieczęciach i w starym herbie miasta, który był w użytku jeszcze w XX w. Nazwa Brama Młyńska pochodzi od młyna, który został wybudowany obok na Kanale Młyńskim w latach 1240-1268. Brama spełniała funkcje kontrolne oraz była uprawniona do pobierania myta za przewóz towarów na rzece. W okresie PRL znajdował się tu punkt informacyjny Polskiego Towarzystwa Turystyczno-Krajoznawczego, zaś później miało tu swoją siedzibę Stargardzkie Stowarzyszenie Miłośników Sztuk Plastycznych Brama.

Podczas kolejnych remontów sylwetka bramy uległa zmianie.', ' W pierwszej poł. XIX w. brama służyła jako areszt, łuk przejazdu zabudowany był wówczas ryglowanymi ścianami. W drugiej połowie XIX w. zabytek przekształcono w duchu neogotyku, zmieniając formę przejazdu i dodając liczne blanki, zaś w 1938 roku wygląd bramy został nieco uspokojony. Nazwa pochodzi od powstałego w XIII wieku młyna na Kanale Młyńskim. Do jej funkcji należała kontrola jak i pobieranie myta za przewóz towarów rzeką.
