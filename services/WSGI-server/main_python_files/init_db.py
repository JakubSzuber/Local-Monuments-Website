The church closes the eastern frontage of the Old Town Square from the south. The lump of the collegiate church is visible from all roads leading into the city. In the Stargard landscape, only the tower of the church - the third-highest in the province, after the Szczecin Archcathedral and St. Mary Church in Chojna - is comparable to it in height. The tower of the Collegiate Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, on the other hand, with its height of 83.5 meters, ranks nineteenth in the country and fifth in the province. The church is often referred to (incorrectly) as a cathedral because of its stately bulk.', ' The original temple was built in 1242, and was made of wood or granite blocks. The establishment of the first church in this place is associated with the location of the city under the Magdeburg law. The church was built - in accordance with the location law - at the newly delineated market square (later Old Town Square). The earliest mention of the functioning of a church in this place comes from 1248, from a document of the Bishop of Kamień Pomorski handing the city over to the Pomeranian principality. In 1292 it was decided to build a new, larger temple. It was to be a votive offering for the granting of Lübeck city rights. The first Gothic brick church was built between 1292 and 1224 on the site of a wooden temple from 1242.The new church was hall-shaped. Inside, it was divided into three naves with an eastern projecting chancel. From the west it was closed with a stepped gable decorated with slender blends. At that time it was a towerless building. At this stage of construction it was modeled on St. Mary Church in Kolobrzeg.', ' In 1388-1500 the church was rebuilt according to the vision of Henrik Brunsberg. It was given the form of a basilica, adding, among other things, a new chancel and a wreath of chapels around the temple, as well as St. Mary Chapel and towers. It was equipped (also by private donors) with more than 50 altars, eight bells and three organs. After the introduction of the Reformation in Pomerania (1534), the Stargard church was also converted to the Lutheran faith. In the 17th century, the church was severely damaged by fire, as was the entire city. Reconstruction took 25 years and gave it a Baroque décor. The regilding was carried out twice: in 1817-19 under the direction of K. Liebenow and at the turn of the 19th/20th century under the direction of Deneke. After he completed the work, the rededication of the temple took place on August 30, 1911 in the presence of the imperial couple - Wilhelm II and Augusta Victoria. As a result of World War II, the roofs and north tower were destroyed, while the interior was devastated. After a makeshift reconstruction in 1946-48, the building was used as a warehouse - until 1957, when Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski reconsecrated the church. Reconstruction continued, and in 1962 the tower helmet was restored; in 1966 a stained glass window dedicated to the parish patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of the World, was funded; it was installed in the window of the western elevation, above the main portal. A new organ was also funded. Until the 1970s, the church was classified as a zero-class monument in the classification of the time. In 1995 it was given the status of a collegiate church. In 2001, renovations began on St. Mary Chapel and the north tower, where an observation deck was opened in 2006. A year later, replacement of the roof tiles over the nave, side aisles and chapels began. At that time, elements of the early 20th century stained glass windows were replenished. Restoration of the temple exterior walls is expected in the coming years. The collegiate church is the seat of the dean of the Stargard East deanery. By decree of the President of the Republic of Poland on September 17, 2010, the collegiate church along with the system of defensive walls was declared a monument of history.', ' The Collegiate Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the southeast corner of Old Town Square, and is oriented according to medieval principles - the chancel facing east. It was built of brick on granite block foundations. It was built on the plan of an elongated rectangle closed on the eastern side with a polygon. The total length of the church is 79.5 m, the width is 37.8 m, the height of the nave is 32.5 m, (it is the highest vaulted church in Poland). The temple is almost entirely a medieval building, erected in stages from the end of the 13th century to the end of the 15th century. As a result of the long construction process, the original church (from the turn of the 13th century), a hall-like, towerless church with a single nave chancel, obtained at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries the shape of a two-towered basilica with a chancel surrounded by an enclosure nave and a wreath of chapels at the enclosure and side aisles. The most impressive body was given to St. Mary Chapel established on the north side of the bypass in the form of an octagon protruding beyond the face of the walls, covered with a separate tented roof. On the opposite, southern side, a rectangular sacristy was built with the Angelic Chapel on the first floor. The facade and interior wall divisions of the various parts of the church; the chancel, the nave body, the chapels at the side aisles and the towers are varied. The different ways of elaborating the walls, windows, pillars, vaults and architectural details of the parts of the buildings are due to the long process of their erection, and reflect the changes in the development of architecture in Pomerania.', ' No one has been able to answer the question of why the old Gothic St. Mary Church in Stargard has two towers, but only one of them - the northern one - is large and imposing, while the other - the southern one - is lower, it is clear that it is unfinished. According to legend, disputes over what St. Mary Church should be like and what its towers should be like erupted even before its construction began in the late 13th century. At the time, Pomerania was ruled by the princes of the Gryfit dynasty. The councilors only agreed that it should be a church so large and magnificent that it would arouse the envy of the inhabitants of Szczecin and even Poznan. However, when they began to discuss how many towers the church should have, the councilors split and an incredible uproar ensued; the mayor struggled to direct the proceedings. The oldest councillor - Luke, the guide of the church brotherhood - declared: There is one God in heaven and one pope, his governor on earth, so the church should also have one tower, but soaring and high, so that prayers can reach heaven sooner. When it seemed that everyone had accepted his statement, a fat, red in the face merchant, Councilman Henry, who had his cloth depots in Hamburg and Bremen, spoke up: Luke speaks well to us, but this is still not the whole truth, after all, we know that in the world we have two rulers - the pope in ecclesiastical matters and the emperor in secular matters, so let dedicate one tower to the pope and the other to the emperor. Still others, and among them the biggest raptus, the elder of the shoemaker guild - Krzych Dratwa, were in favor of dedicating one tower to the prince instead of the emperor: after all, he is ours and lives closer. The day was approaching west, and there was no agreement. However, the church began to be built, and years later the tall north tower was erected and named the papal tower. As the second, the imperial tower was to be elevated, but then a war broke out in Europe between the emperor and the pope for the primacy of world government, and it was not known who would prevail. The southern tower was also not erected because the fashion in architecture was for a single tower in churches.', 'https://zabytki.tomekzuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stargard-kosciol-NMP-Krolowej-Swiata-01.jpg')")

The Gothic St. John the Baptist Church dominates Stargard skyline and is its tallest building. In its present form it dates from the 15th century, but its architectural and historical tradition puts it at the top of Stargard churches. In the 13th century the Stargard Order of St. John of Jerusalem built a monastery and a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist here. Although no written information about the shape of this chapel has survived, it is possible to partially reconstruct its form from fragments salvaged in the pillars of the chancel of the present church.  In 1351, Odilia, the wife of Novogard craftsman Heinrich Schmidt, founded altars dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle, St. Margaret and St. Jerome.  In 1388, the clergyman Reynoldus Block donated 200 marks for the making of the altar of the Body of Christ, which was founded in 1429 by Father Albert Tuscher. The foundation of the altar of the Body of Christ was connected with the establishment of the Confraternity of the Holy Body (or Blessed Sacrament). The chapel with the altar was probably initially located outside the Chapel of St. John the Baptist. Later it was moved to a chapel added to the north side. In 1398, a decision was made to expand the St. John Chapel into a church under the auspices of the City Council. For ten years funds were raised so that in 1408 construction of the tower and the body of the church began simultaneously. The start of construction is indicated by a plaque set into the wall of the tower, made of limestone, which bears the following Latin inscription: \"and was in the year 1408, on the day of the martyrdom of St. George [April 24] with the help of Messrs. Matthew Schonenberch, Henning Busseler, Henry Bachwerk of the provisionals of this church. God work has begun.\" St. John Chapel now became the chancel of the new church. Construction of the tower began on the west side. Meanwhile, the space between the chancel and the tower was transformed into the body of the church. Star vaults in the shape of eight-pointed stars were also established.', ' In one of the oldest views of Stargard dating back to the 17th century, the church tower has a crenellation, characteristic of medieval defensive buildings. A pyramid sprouts from its rim. The tower was completed in 1429, at which time the St. Mary Chapel was erected on the south side. Today the entrance to the tower is located there. Finally, in 1463, the oldest of the bells was founded. Around 1500, a chancel bypass and a series of chapels were erected to surround the eastern part of the church. Cross and crystal vaults were created in them. Crystal vaults (not counting those of the Dominican church in Mysliborz) are a rarity in all of Western Pomerania. Counting from the side of the sacristy, the following chapels were erected: the Canvassers, St. Nicholas, the Three Kings (under the patronage of the Knights of St. John), the Ten Thousand Knights and Martyrs (belonging to the von Köseke, Maskow and Walter families), St. Philip and James (the baker chapel), the Furriers and the St. Andrew Chapel, which does not exist today. In 1556, the church passed into the hands of a Protestant clergyman - Hermann Ricke. As required by the principles of the Protestant liturgy, wooden empores (balconies) were built between the pillars, and a pulpit took center stage in the church.', ' During the Napoleonic wars, the church was requisitioned for five years by French troops. In 1813 a lazaret was set up in the temple, then a hay store, and finally it was turned into a prison. After the fall of Napoleon, the church again served a religious function, new plaster and flooring were put on, and stained glass windows were inserted. However, in 1836 a powerful windstorm tore off the roof over the body of the church. The church was repaired inside the nave body in 1883, while the rest of the building was restored in late 1892 and early 1893. At that time, the southern elevation of the body was redone, the western portal in the tower was bricked up and a new one - narrower and lower - was put in place. The most visible change was the establishment of a new tower helmet, whose height (including the tower) is 99 meters. Since the destruction of the tower helmet of St. Jacob Cathedral in Szczecin in 1945, the tower of St. John is the tallest in Western Pomerania and the third tallest in Poland.', ' As a result of the invasion of Soviet troops in March 1945, the roof over the body of the church was partially destroyed, which was repaired a year later. Meanwhile, two artillery shells were lodged in the tower. The church was consecrated on June 19, 1946 by Father Tadeusz Długopolski TChr, the first parish priest in post-war Stargard. The historic furnishings of the church were dispersed. Until World War II, the most valuable equipment in the church was a large late Gothic St. John polyptych from the second half of the 15th century, the work of a Pomeranian workshop, with, however, visible influences from the art of Hamburg and Rostock. The central cabinet housed large sculptures of Mary and Christ and scenes from the life of St. John. It was dismantled before the war effort in 1945 and deposited in the Tychow branch church. The Baroque pulpit was taken deep into Germany in 1945. In 1954, the roof was repaired and the organ was restored. Three years later, new floors were laid, a balustrade was set up in front of the chancel, two bells were repaired and repair work began on the church tower. In 1958-1961, the interior was renovated. Polychromes of the Archangels, Evangelists and the scene of Christ Baptism in the Jordan River were also created at this time. The next two saw the installation of an electrical system, which the church had previously lacked, lighting and a sound system. In the mid-1990s, the interior of the church was painted.', ' In the spring of 1998, during repairs to the tower finial, a collection of documents and coins was discovered, along with a letter from the church pastor, dated August 17, 1893, placed in a metal ball. The discovered items are stored at the Museum of Archeology and History at the Old Town Square. Until World War II, St. John Church had rich furnishings. Its most valuable element was a large late Gothic St. John polyptych from the second half of the 15th century, the work of a Pomeranian workshop, but with visible influences from the art of Hamburg and Rostock. The central cabinet housed large sculptures of Mary and Christ and scenes from the life of St. John. It was dismantled before the war effort in 1945 and deposited in the Tychow branch church. It is now in the National Museum in Szczecin. The Baroque pulpit was taken deep into Germany in 1945. The organ, built by organmaster Wagner, dates from 1731. In the northern part of the church by the sacristy are 15th century four-seat stalls with carved walls. In 2005 the relics of St. Raphael Kalinowski were purchased for the church.', 'https://www.pomorzezachodnie.travel/media/cache/artykul_miniatura_big/media/original/media/default/0001/06/8197bedfd5a1277284357f83be8b29945aa49fc3.JPG')")

The front of the Pyrzyce Gate was rebuilt after a fire in 1666, and was finally demolished in the late 19th century. The gate housed bedrooms for the crew, and from the upper gallery the entrance to the city was guarded day and night. The different floors were separated by wooden ceilings connected by stairs. Later alterations were limited only to the gable part of the building. In the 17th century, a signature was placed on the roof, and clock faces were placed in the gables.

The first building erected on the site of today city hall was a hall called the Merchant House (1250-1280). The building was a one-story, brick structure, the size corresponding to the outline of the city hall walls. In the course of time, meetings of city jurors began to be held there. At the end of the 14th century, the merchant house was completely rebuilt, becoming the seat of municipal authorities and the merchant patriciate. The rebuilt town hall continued to house the market hall and punishment room on the first floor, while the first floor housed the mayor office, chancellery, councilor meeting room, courtroom and treasury. The cellars were used as warehouses for visiting merchants. During the holidays, the first floor hall was a playground for the townspeople. A great fire in 1540 destroyed more than 100 buildings, including the town hall; it took 29 years to rebuild. In its history, the town hall succumbed to several more fires. First during the Swedish wars in the 17th century, when the priceless city archive burned down, and again along with the entire Old Town in 1945 during World War II. Reconstruction began by securing the ruins, with all the work taking place from 1948 to 1961. In June 2000, a sixty-kilogram clock was installed on the front gable. It chimes full and half hours. The clock is synchronized by an atomic standard located in Frankfurt am Main. Every day at 12 am. a bugle call is sounded from the city hall by Waldemar Cieślak.', ' The reconstruction resulted in the original city hall, which was a one-story building with stepped gables decorated with blends and with pointed windows. The front facade was formed by a gable on the west side. The building was covered by a gable roof with rows of windows illuminating the usable attic. During the reconstruction in 1569 after the fire, rich masquerade decorations of the gables were introduced, and the shape and size of the windows were changed. The new decor of the town hall must have gained the townspeople appreciation, as two other townhouses with similar gable decorations were built in a short time. The town hall, destroyed after World War II, was rebuilt on the basis of drawings and photographs, restoring the state of decoration from the late 19th century. The entrance on the east side was eliminated, the shape of the windows was changed, the entire building was plastered, and the interiors were adapted to the administrative needs of the seat of the city government.', ' The office has a queuing system - a ticket machine to improve customer service. The office is adapted for the needs of the disabled. Persons with disabilities who have difficulty communicating can use the assistance of a sign language interpreter or interpreter-guide when doing their business at the office. The interpreter service is free of charge for people with a disability certificate. Persons wishing to use the interpreter assistance must declare their intention to do so at least 3 days before the planned visit - by phone, e-mail or fax. The building has an elevator for people with physical disabilities. Adjacent to the building, on Kramarska Street, there are free parking spaces for cars, including designated spaces for the disabled and spaces for honeymooner cars. Between the City Hall and St. Mary Collegiate Church there is free parking for about 30 cars. One of the most impressive Gothic town halls preserved to this day in Western Pomerania.The building, dating back to the 13th century, has been rebuilt several times, in the 2. Half of the 16th century, topped with a Gothic-Renaissance gable with exceptionally rich masquerade decoration, which was reconstructed during the post-war reconstruction. Today it is one of the main architectural accents of Stargard Old Town, and at the same time one of the most valuable monuments of Stargard.', ' History of the town hall - the town of Stargard was located by Duke Barnim I in 1253, and then again in 1278 by Dukes Boguslaw IV, Barnim II, Otto I under Lübeck law. As many as 19 town councilors are mentioned in the same year. A merchant house was probably built as early as the 1360s. Erected on the outline of the foundations of the current town hall, it survives in the perimeter walls of the current building to the ground level. The building south-facing facade was flanked by two winding staircases. At the ground level was a large two-nave hall covered with a ceiling supported by alternating wooden and brick columns. At the end of the 14th century, the existing building was raised by one story. A merchant hall was left on the first floor, while administrative rooms were located on the 1st floor - a meeting room, a courtroom, a mayor room, a chancellery, an archive, a treasury and others. The front elevation now faced west, towards the Market Square. In its ground floor was located the portal of the main entrance. The second story was divided by seven windows closed with segmental arches, and the whole was crowned by a high triangular gable. The side elevations were divided on the first floor by alternating ogival windows and blinds closed with segmental arches, and on the first floor - by smaller windows and blinds, also closed with segmental arches. The third stage of construction of the city hall, after the fire of 1540, was completed by 1569.Both the facades and interior of the building were then transformed in transitional forms between Gothic and Renaissance. In the hall on the first floor, columns were replaced with stone columns with twisted shafts. The form of the windows of the two upper floors of the facade was changed, as well as the windows of the 1st floor of the eastern and southern elevations, which were closed with cataract arches. The façade received a new gable, divided by cornices, which was decorated with a rich masquerade ornament. All facades were plastered. In 1635, the town hall was destroyed by another fire. The reconstruction that now followed resulted in the early Baroque volute gable of the eastern elevation. The form of the façade gable was also changed, with the upper, damaged tier rebuilt in a new form with a circular blend and volutes on the sides. At that time, the closures of the facade windows were probably also transformed, replacing the cataract arch with a segmental arch. In 1896-1897 the restoration of the town hall was carried out under the direction of Stargard architect D. Deneke. The work involved uncovering and partially reconstructing late Gothic elements. The façade gable finial was reconstructed in its presumed original form, window closures in the form of cataract arches were restored, and ogival arcades were made in place of windows in both gable elevations. In 1945, the town hall was about 75% destroyed. Mainly the perimeter walls survived, but the decorative gables were destroyed. Reconstruction began in 1947, when the ruin was deconstructed. The following year, proper construction work began, and 1949 saw the reconstruction of the western gable. This work was carried out by a city brigade from Stargard under the supervision of the PKZ in Gdansk. After a break of several years, further work resumed in 1957. The reconstruction project was carried out by Eng. F. Dzierżanowski of PKZ Gdansk. As a result of the works carried out, both gables were reconstructed, reproducing, among other things, the entire decoration of the facade. The cataract arches over the windows were restored, and the ogival arcades in the gable elevations were eliminated and replaced with windows. The entrance in the eastern elevation was also not restored. In the interior, a completely new two-and-a-half-tract layout was introduced, eliminating the old divisions. The work was completed in 1961, and the rebuilt city hall became the seat of the municipal authorities.', ' The Town Hall is located in the eastern frontage of the Old Town Square at the exit of Kramarska Street.

Above the basement preserved barrel vaults, the other floors covered with massive ceilings from the post-war reconstruction. The roof is covered with plain tile. Facades divided by cordon and parapet cornices. First floor windows closed with a segmental arch, 1st floor openings (except on the northern elevation) and the top of the facade - with a cataract arch. The ground floor façade is four-axial, with a pointed-arch portal with profiled reveals, located asymmetrically in the second axis from the south. The axes of the 1st floor and attic windows are inconsistent with the axes of the first floor openings. The top of the facade is stepped with edges formed by quarters of circles, divided by cornices into five zones. Between the cornices rich masquerade decoration with motifs including interpenetrating circles, ogives and other geometric figures. The eastern elevation is four-axis, topped with a late Renaissance volute gable, divided by cornices into four zones.
